# Wealthfolio Connect Self-hosted

> A self-hosted companion server for the
> [Wealthfolio](https://github.com/wealthfolio/wealthfolio) **web edition**
> (the self-hosted Docker image that ships out of `apps/server`),
> for users who can't or won't use a hosted sync service.

> **Scope.** This server targets the **web edition** of Wealthfolio — the
> Docker image you self-host on your own box, configured via
> `CONNECT_AUTH_URL` / `CONNECT_AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `CONNECT_API_URL`.
> It is **not** intended for the Tauri desktop app, which talks to the same
> HTTP contract but seeds its session through the local OS keyring.

## 👉 Please use the official Wealthfolio Connect if you can

The [Wealthfolio](https://wealthfolio.app) web edition is built and
maintained by [@afadil](https://github.com/afadil) and contributors, who
have given the entire app away for free under AGPL-3.0. The
**Wealthfolio Connect** hosted service is how that work gets paid for.

If the official Connect fits your needs — **please subscribe to it**.
It's the right thing to do, it keeps the upstream project healthy, and
whatever you pay there is almost certainly less than the value
Wealthfolio gives you back. Open source survives on people choosing to
pay when they don't strictly have to.

This project exists for the (small) set of users for whom hosted Connect
is genuinely not an option:

- **Strict data-residency or compliance rules** that forbid sending
  broker credentials or holdings off-prem.
- **Regions / payment methods** the official Connect doesn't serve.
- **Hobbyist self-hosters** who run their own infra for everything as a
  matter of principle.

If none of those describe you, close this tab and go to
[wealthfolio.app](https://wealthfolio.app). 🙏

## What this is

A single Go binary that speaks the same HTTP contract the Wealthfolio
web edition already uses to talk to its sync backend, so your self-hosted
Wealthfolio web instance can point at a server you control instead of the
hosted Connect. Data is pulled directly from each broker by this binary —
no third-party data aggregator sits between you and the exchange:

- **Futu Securities** — TCP/protobuf to a local **Futu OpenD** daemon (`hurisheng/go-futu-api`)
- **Interactive Brokers** — socket protocol to a local **IB Gateway / TWS** (`scmhub/ibapi`)
- **Binance Spot** — REST API (`adshao/go-binance/v2`)
- **OKX CEX** — signed v5 REST API (HMAC-SHA256)
- **OKX Web3 / DEX** — signed v5 REST API for on-chain wallet aggregation
- **Bitget Spot** — signed v2 REST API
- **Hyperliquid** — public `/info` endpoint, wallet-address only (read-only)

All data is normalised into the Wealthfolio API shape and persisted in
PostgreSQL on your own infrastructure.

## Relationship with upstream Wealthfolio

This is an **independent, unaffiliated** project — not endorsed by,
sponsored by or supported by the Wealthfolio team. The HTTP contract this
server implements is part of the upstream open-source codebase, so this
is interoperation against a *published* protocol, not reverse
engineering. No upstream code is copied or linked into this binary.

"Wealthfolio" and "Wealthfolio Connect" are trademarks of their
respective owners and are used here solely to describe compatibility.

The architecture follows **Domain-Driven Design** (see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md))
and uses **uber-go/fx** for dependency injection.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22+**
- **PostgreSQL 14+**
- **Docker** (for containerised deployment)
- **Futu OpenD** running locally — only needed if you enable the Futu integration ([download](https://www.futunn.com/en/download/openAPI))
- **IB Gateway** or **TWS** running locally — only needed if you enable the IBKR integration
- (Optional) **mockgen** for regenerating gomock mocks: `go install go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@latest`
- (Optional) **golangci-lint** for linting: see [installation guide](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-org/wealthfolio-connect-open.git
cd wealthfolio-connect-open

# 2. Configure environment
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/wealthfolio?sslmode=disable"
export JWT_SECRET="change-me-to-a-long-random-string"
export CONNECT_AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-publishable-key"

# 3. Run (migrations execute automatically on startup)
go run ./cmd/server

# 4. Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

### Point the Wealthfolio web edition at this server

The Wealthfolio web container reads its Connect endpoints from environment
variables at runtime (the frontend pulls them through `get_connect_config`).
Set the following on the **Wealthfolio web** container — not on this one —
and restart it:

```bash
CONNECT_AUTH_URL=https://connect.your-domain.example         # base URL of THIS server
CONNECT_AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key            # must match the value below
CONNECT_API_URL=https://connect.your-domain.example          # usually the same host
# Optional: only needed if you wire the OAuth-style callback flow.
# CONNECT_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL=https://wealthfolio.your-domain.example/auth/callback
```

Then, in the Wealthfolio web UI, sign in to Connect with any email that is on
this server's `ALLOWED_EMAILS` allow-list and any 6-digit OTP (or `STATIC_OTP`
if configured). The session JWT and refresh token are persisted by the
Wealthfolio backend and reused across restarts — there is no separate "seed"
step, the OS-keyring dance only applies to the Tauri desktop build.

| `ALLOWED_EMAILS`                | Comma-separated email allow-list for the synthetic OTP login. See below.    |

### Optional — System

| Name                    | Default                   | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SERVER_PORT`           | `8080`                    | HTTP listen port.                                                                            |
| `LOG_LEVEL`             | `info`                    | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error`.                                                         |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`          | `*`                       | Comma-separated list of allowed origins.                                                     |

| `STATIC_TOKEN_MODE`     | `false`                   | If `true`, always returns the same JWT.                                                      |
| `TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`     | `3600`                    | Access token lifetime.                                                                       |
| `STATIC_OTP`            | —                         | Optional fixed OTP code accepted by `/auth/v1/verify` in addition to any 6-digit numeric code. |

Every broker integration is **opt-in** — leave its credentials empty and the
corresponding client is silently skipped at startup. You only need to supply
the variables for the brokers you actually want to sync.

### Futu Securities (TCP to local OpenD)

Futu OpenD must already be running on the same host (or reachable network)
as this server. The server connects via TCP and signs trade requests with
your OpenD trading password.

| Name                 | Default      | Description                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FUTU_HOST`          | `127.0.0.1`  | OpenD host. Empty disables Futu.                                           |
| `FUTU_PORT`          | `11111`      | OpenD TCP port.                                                            |
| `FUTU_TRADE_PASSWORD`| —            | The trading password ("交易密码 / 交易密码 MD5") configured in OpenD.       |
| `FUTU_CONNECTION_ID` | `wealthfolio`| Logical connection identifier surfaced in the snapshot.                    |

### Interactive Brokers (socket to local IB Gateway / TWS)

Run **IB Gateway** (recommended) or **TWS** locally with API socket access
enabled. Allow this server's IP in the gateway's *Trusted IPs* list.

| Name              | Default     | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IBKR_HOST`       | `127.0.0.1` | IB Gateway / TWS host. Empty disables IBKR.                            |
| `IBKR_PORT`       | `4001`      | `4001` for live IB Gateway, `4002` paper, `7496` TWS, `7497` TWS paper.|
| `IBKR_CLIENT_ID`  | `1`         | Any unique integer — must not clash with other API clients.            |
| `IBKR_ACCOUNT_ID` | —           | Optional account filter (e.g. `U1234567`); empty pulls every account.  |

> **Operational caveats.** IB Gateway is the weakest link in any IBKR
> integration: sessions die after ~24h of uptime, the daily reset window
> forces re-login, and Two-Factor Authentication can ask for a phone tap at
> any reconnect. The current client treats every `Fetch()` as a fresh
> attempt and surfaces the underlying error — it does not auto-restart the
> gateway. Recommended deployment hardening:
>
> - Run IB Gateway under a process supervisor (`systemd`, `supervisord`,
>   or `ibc` from [IbcAlpha/IBC](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC)) that
>   restarts the daemon nightly before the daily reset.
> - Use IBC + a dedicated *paper* + *live* user pair when possible; paper
>   sessions do not enforce 2FA.
> - Monitor `/healthz` and the sync logs for repeated `IBKR_*` errors;
>   alert when consecutive failures exceed `SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES`.
> - If 2FA prompts become disruptive, evaluate IBKR's *Read-only login*
>   option, which suppresses the second factor for market-data + portfolio
>   queries.

## Authentication

This server impersonates the subset of Supabase Auth that Wealthfolio's
`wealthfolio-connect` feature talks to. There is **no real email provider,
no real OTP storage, and no per-user database**: gating is done by the
`apikey` header (`CONNECT_AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) plus the `ALLOWED_EMAILS`
allow-list. The server is expected to be reachable only over a trusted
network (VPN, reverse proxy, IP allow-list, ...).

### Login flow

### OTP policy

`/auth/v1/verify` accepts a token if **either** of the following holds:

- the token matches `^[0-9]{6}$` (any 6-digit numeric code), **or**
- `STATIC_OTP` is set and the token equals that value (constant-time
  comparison).

There is intentionally no per-email OTP storage, no expiry, no rate limit
on this endpoint — the apikey + allow-list are the gates that matter. If
you need stronger guarantees, put the server behind a reverse proxy that
rate-limits `/auth/v1/*`.

### Subject derivation

The JWT `sub` claim is `sha256(lowercased email)` reformatted as a UUID
v4 string. This keeps the raw email out of access logs / downstream
services while remaining stable across token refreshes for the same
address, and parses cleanly as a UUID — which `supabase-js` requires.

## Development

```bash
# Run tests with race detector and coverage
go test ./... -race -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1

# Lint
golangci-lint run

# Vet
go vet ./...

# Regenerate mocks
go generate ./...
```

Coverage threshold is **≥ 90%** — CI will fail below that.

---

## Docker

```bash
# Build the multi-stage image
docker build -t wealthfolio-connect-open:latest .

# Run
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." \
  -e JWT_SECRET="..." \
  -e CONNECT_AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="..." \
  wealthfolio-connect-open:latest
```

The container exposes `SERVER_PORT` (default `8080`) and provides
`/healthz` + `/readyz` for Kubernetes probes.

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow at [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml):

- Runs on every PR and push to `main`.
- Steps: `go vet` → `golangci-lint` → `go test -race -coverprofile` → coverage gate (≥ 90%).
- A PostgreSQL service container is provisioned for integration tests.
- On `main`, the multi-stage Docker image is built and pushed using the
  `REGISTRY_URL` / `REGISTRY_USERNAME` / `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` repo secrets.
